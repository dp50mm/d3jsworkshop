# d3jsworkshop

A repository for some html files that can be used in a beginner d3js workshop.
The idea is that the workshop participants download the repository, host it on a public dropbox folder and go through the steps by editing the exercise files.
For each of the exercises there is an example file where the exercises are filled in already.


## exercise one: shapes
Exercise one covers the steps for creating an SVG element in your document and adding shapes.


## exercise two: data
Exercise two covers the various methods and structure for working with data in d3js.
